# IPE Blogging Application Post: Our Trip to Iceland!

## Why am I even blogging about this?
As I prepare for my upcoming international experience to Berlin, I am pleasantly reminded of my previous trip out of the USA, which took place just a little over a week ago during spring break! My friends and I went on a week-long road trip in Iceland, which has long been an elusive and mysterious destination that has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. My goals for the trip were firm and clear - soak in as much of the rugged and beautiful scenery as I could, and witness the Northern Lights with my very own eyes. I hope to capture as many of my memories and feelings of those magical seven days as I possibly can.

## Day 0: Detroit -> Reykjavik
Our journey began with a quick domestic flight from Detroit to Baltimore, which is one of the main connecting hubs between North America and Iceland. The Delta flight was efficient and punctual, arriving in Baltimore over 20 minutes early due to a generous tailwind. We settled down quickly and did some homework in the airside area while waiting for our next flight, a little over 6 hours away. We were greeted with an amazing Maryland sunset sprawling the horizon above the airport tarmac, which was a welcome sight for sure!

Sadly I didn't get many photos of the Icelandair flight but it too was uneventful. I had some some reservations flying on the infamous Boeing 737 MAX 8 over an open expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, but after a few prayers, earplugs and eye shades, I fell soundly asleep for a good portion of the red-eye flight. As we were nearing Iceland, I attempted to use long-exposure to take a photo out of the window in an attempt to try and capture any aurora light, but was met with no success. This photo was pretty cool though:

## Day 1 - Hot Springs, Volcanic Craters
Landing in Reykjavik the weather was stunning and yet piercingly cold! A beautiful cloudless sunrise awaited us, however there was a sharp chilly breeze that cut through our jackets and felt very different from the Michigan cold that we are all used to. We quickly picked up our rental car, a nifty and reliable Suzuki Vitara 4x4, and headed off to our first destination: Sky Lagoon Hot Spring, which is the second-most famous hot spring in Iceland, the first being the Blue Lagoon, which is not the safest place to currently be at due to its unnerving proximity to the recent Grindavik volcano eruption. Though I must say that as a volcanic island teeming with geothermal activity, the tourist industry has put this to fantastic use.

Sky Lagoon Hot Spring offers a massive main hot bath, a cold plunge at 2 degrees Celsius, and a 7-step spa ritual with various treatments like perfume, salt, steam rooms and more. We opted for the basic combination which does not include the ritual as we just wanted to soak in the warm water and take in the sights. After a nice shower in a dark-cladded locker room, it was time to enter the pool! Thankfully, I had brought along my trust DJI Osmo Action 4 vlogging camera which is fully waterproof, so I was able to capture some cool moments in the hot spring.

One of the most interesting feelings ever is sitting in the cold plunge for 20 seconds, then going back to the hot water. The entire body feels numb and simultaneously electrified with the sudden 38 degree temperature change, which is supposed to be a 'natural shock treatment' of sorts that has various health benefits including circulation, skin, etc.

After the hot spring it was time for lunch! We headed to Icelandic Street Food in Reykjavik which is a well-known destination for cheap and authentic eats. By American standards, the food was expensive at around $25 per head, but this is incredibly considered reasonable by Icelandic standards! The notable dishes include: Kjötsúpa (Traditional lamb stew), Plokkfiskur (Creamy mashed potato with cod) and other soups, all served in large bread bowls with unlimited refills! Needless to say, we left feeling utterly stuffed!

Following this, it was full-steam down the main Icelandic highway, headed out of the city and into the wilderness to begin our adventure proper. Our first stop was Kerid crater, which is an extinct cone volcano which erupted and emptied its magma reserve. Once the magma was depleted, the weight of the cone collapsed into the empty magma chamber and created a depression in the ground which filled with water, forming a magnificent crater lake. We dorned our crampons and trudged down to the crater, which was completely frozen into a magnificent 'ice-skating rink' of sorts! Definitely not something you can see anywhere else, a beautiful frozen lake in an extinct volcano!
