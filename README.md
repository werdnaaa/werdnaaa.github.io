# Apologetics (from Greek ἀπολογία, "speaking in defense")

## If God knows everything/is omniscient, do we actually have free will?

I have long been concerned with this conundrum – the problem of an omniscient God and free will. We've always been taught that God created humans to be in loving, covenantal fellowship with Him (John 1:3), giving us free will to love Him back, or not.

If we believe that God gives complete free choice to exert our will, does this mean that He must (to an extent) preclude Himself from knowledge of our future decisions? A supposedly infinite, omniscient God cannot possibly limit Himself as that would be self-defeating i.e. undermining one’s own nature. But if God truly knows everything, then how much choice do we really have to make autonomous decisions? To make things worse, Romans 8 states that God foreknows those who would choose Him, and even elects them into His kingdom (Romans 8:28-30). Many Biblical examples imply that Jesus knows exactly what people are going to do, good/bad, before they do any action. This is very concerning, because if all actions are pre-determined/pre-destined, prospect of free will is nullified.

I think I finally have an answer to the above two contentions. God cannot force us to freely love Him – that’s a logical contradiction. God created the rules of logic and cannot do things that are logically impossible i.e. self-defeating, such as creating a married bachelor or a square circle. God’s inability to do such things are not a limitation of His own power. They simply adhere to the laws He created Himself.

I recently realized that free will does not necessarily mean that God must preclude Himself from foreknowledge. God can have full knowledge of our actions, yet at the same time give us complete self-control. This is not a logical contradiction. Because God is beyond time (Colossians 1:17), having created it. To us humans, we view time on linear scale, going from left to right:

Before – should I steal the wallet?

During – I'm stealing it.

After – Yay I stole it.

Before the decision was made, the future was truly unknown to us as our universe’s ‘time-arrow’ has not yet reached that point on the timeline. But God stands outside the timeline and views it, and is able to see past, present, and future simultaneously. It’s almost as if every single decision was decided by us at the point of creation of the timeline, yet we have yet to execute those decisions in our timescale, so we view that decision as being currently undetermined. Furthermore, I previously failed to note the distinct difference between causing a decision to happen, and knowing that it will happen.

In short, all decisions that we have made and will make have always been decided, but we are the agents that make those decisions and actualize them as we pass along the timelines of life. It’s just that we view our actions as taking place on a linear timeline, while to God, it has always happened. After all He does say, “I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning, and the end.” (Revelation 22:13)
