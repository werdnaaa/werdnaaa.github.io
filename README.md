# IPE Blogging Application Post: Our Trip to Iceland!

## Why am I even blogging about this?
As I prepare for my upcoming international experience to Berlin, I am pleasantly reminded of my previous trip out of the USA, which took place just a little over a week ago during spring break! My friends and I went on a week-long road trip in Iceland, which has long been an elusive and mysterious destination that has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. My goals for the trip were firm and clear - soak in as much of the rugged and beautiful scenery as I could, and witness the Northern Lights with my own eyes. I hope to capture as many of my memories and feelings of those magical seven days as I possibly can.

## Day 0: Detroit -> Reykjavik
Our journey began with a quick domestic flight from Detroit to Baltimore, which is one of the main connecting hubs between North America and Iceland. The Delta flight was efficient and punctual, arriving in Baltimore over 20 minutes early due to a generous tailwind. We settled down quickly and did some homework in the airside area while waiting for our next flight, a little over 6 hours away. We were greeted with an amazing Maryland sunset sprawling the horizon above the airport tarmac, which was a welcome sight for sure!

Sadly I didn't get many photos of the Icelandair flight but it too was uneventful. I had some some reservations flying on the infamous Boeing 737 MAX 8 over an open expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean, but after a few prayers, earplugs and eye shades, I fell soundly asleep for a good portion of the red-eye flight. As we were nearing Iceland, I attempted to use long-exposure to take a photo out of the window in an attempt to try and capture any aurora light, but was met with no success. This photo was pretty cool though:
