# IPE Blogging Application Post: Our Trip to Iceland!

## Why am I even blogging about this?
As I prepare for my upcoming international experience to Berlin, I am pleasantly reminded of my previous trip out of the USA, which took place just a little over a week ago during spring break! My friends and I went on a week-long road trip in Iceland, which has long been an elusive and mysterious destination that has been on my bucket list for as long as I can remember. My goals for the trip were firm and clear - soak in as much of the rugged and beautiful scenery as I could, and witness the Northern Lights with my own eyes.
